                    <h3>Icon of Paris</h3>
                    <p>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.</p>
                    
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>The Eiffel Tower was built as the centerpiece of the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair), held to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution. Gustave Eiffel's company, which specialized in metal structural work, was given the contract after the original design by Maurice Koechlin and Ã‰mile Nouguier was approved.</p>
                    <p>Construction began in January 1887 and was completed in March 1889. At 300 meters (984 feet) tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930.</p>
